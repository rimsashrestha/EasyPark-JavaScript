# 🚗 EasyPark - Smart Parking System (JavaScript)

**EasyPark** is a browser-based smart parking system simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases how digital systems can manage parking slot availability in real time — great for demos, beginner projects, or learning DOM manipulation and event handling.

## 🌟 Features

- Real-time parking slot status updates
- Interactive UI with visual feedback (available vs occupied)
- Simple booking system for vehicles
- Reset & availability check functions
- Pure frontend — no backend or frameworks

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS / DOM APIs)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rimsashrestha/EasyPark-JavaScript.git
cd EasyPark-JavaScript
```
### 2. Open the App
Just open the index.html file in your browser — no setup needed!

Or right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server" if you're using VS Code with the Live Server extension.

## 📁 File Structure
EasyPark-JavaScript/
├── index.html          # Main HTML page
├── style.css           # Styling for the app
└── script.js           # JavaScript logic (parking actions, UI updates)

### 🧠 How It Works
The app displays multiple parking slots as boxes.

Clicking an available slot "books" it — changing its color to indicate it's occupied.

Clicking again frees the slot.

The status is updated in real time using DOM manipulation.

This project is a great beginner-friendly way to learn about:

Event listeners

Class toggling in CSS

Managing application state with JS

Responsive layout using Flexbox/Grid

### 📌 Possible Future Features
Persistent state using localStorage

Timer-based billing system

Parking history tracking

Real-time slot sync via backend
